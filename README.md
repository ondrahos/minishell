## Minishell Project Summary

### Project Overview

The Minishell project at 42 School challenges students to create a simple Unix shell program, providing a command-line interface for users to interact with their operating system. It serves as an introduction to system calls, process management, and parsing user commands.

### Key Objectives

- Implement a basic shell capable of executing commands entered by the user.
- Handle basic built-in commands like `cd`, `echo`, `env`, and manage environment variables.
- Support redirection, piping, and signal handling to enhance functionality.
- Ensure robust error handling and graceful termination of processes.

### Core Features

1. **Command Execution:**
   - Parse user input and execute commands using system calls like `fork`, `execve`, and `waitpid`.

2. **Built-in Commands:**
   - Implement built-in commands like `cd`, `echo`, `env`, `exit`, etc., to manage the shell environment.

3. **Redirection and Piping:**
   - Support input/output redirection and piping for more complex command execution.

4. **Signal Handling:**
   - Handle signals like `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) and `Ctrl+Z` (SIGTSTP) to gracefully terminate or suspend processes.

### Benefits

- Deepens understanding of Unix system calls and process management.
- Improves proficiency in C programming and handling command-line interfaces.
- Provides hands-on experience with parsing techniques and handling user input.

### Conclusion

The Minishell project offers a practical introduction to building a Unix shell, providing students with valuable skills in system programming and command-line interface development. Through this project, students at 42 School gain insight into the inner workings of operating systems and develop essential programming skills for software development.
